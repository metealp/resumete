                    The Human Library aims to address people's prejudices by helping them to talk to those they would not normally meet. The organization has a chapter in Istanbul Technical University and organize various events every year. I personally contributed to the project as a "book", so "bookworms" can ask their questions and challenge their prejudices.

                    Food Not Bombs is an all-volunteer global movement that shares free vegan meals as a protest to war and poverty. I gathered surplus food from groceries which would otherwise go to waste, cooked with friends as if it is a festival and shared with homeless people in Istanbul.
